Team Treehouse Techdegree Project 5

-I used the fetch API to request user data.
-The user data can be filtered with the help of a search field.
-Once a card is clicked a modal opens up. The user can toggle throught the modals.
-A search feature works with upper case as well as lower case letters
-I set font and border colors to black
-I set the modal buttons to black
-I used #a5b59a as background color for the body and the modal containers
-I set the border-radius of the images to 0.25em so they match the cards
